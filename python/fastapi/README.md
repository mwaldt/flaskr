# fastapi tutorial

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/creating-first-rest-api-with-fastapi/

The official docs for this tool are rather verbose and go into a deep dive of what their tool can do without giving a solid example application to build. So I went with this one as it gives the user something they can interact with via the docs webgui.


## Running

To get this running `make setup run`

From there you can view the docs at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
